<h1>Lists</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Lists are very similar to arrays. They can contain any type of variable, and they can contain as many variables as you wish. Lists can also be iterated over in a very simple manner. Here is an example of how to build a list.</p>
<pre>
                        <code>mylist = []
                        mylist.append(1)
                        mylist.append(2)
                        mylist.append(3)
                        print(mylist[0]) # prints 1
                        print(mylist[1]) # prints 2
                        print(mylist[2]) # prints 3

                        # prints out 1,2,3
                        for x in mylist:
                            print(x)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
<p>Accessing an index which does not exist generates an exception (an error).</p>
<pre>
                        <code>mylist = [1,2,3]
                        print(mylist[10])
                        </code>
                    </pre>
<h2>Exercise</h2>
<p>In this exercise, you will need to add numbers and strings to the correct lists using the "append" list method. You must add the numbers 1,2, and 3 to the "numbers" list, and the words 'hello' and 'world' to the strings variable.</p>
<p>
    You will also have to fill in the variable second_name with the second name in the names list, using the brackets operator
    <code>[]</code>
    . Note that the index is zero-based, so if you want to access the second item in the list, its index will be 1.
