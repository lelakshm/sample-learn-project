<h1>Hello, World!</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Python is a very simple language, and has a very straightforward syntax.
    It encourages programmers to program without boilerplate (prepared) code.
    The simplest directive in Python is the "print" directive -
    it simply prints out a line (and also includes a newline, unlike in C).</p>
<p>There are two major Python versions, Python 2 and Python 3. Python 2 and 3 are quite different.
    This tutorial uses Python 3, because it more semantically correct and supports newer features.</p>
<p>
    For example, one difference between Python 2 and 3 is the
    <code>print</code>
    statement.
    In Python 2, the "print" statement is not a function, and therefore it is
    invoked without parentheses. However, in Python 3, it is a function, and must be invoked
    with parentheses.
</p>
<p>To print a string in Python 3, just write:</p>
<pre>
                        <code>print("This line will be printed.")
                        </code>
                    </pre>
<h3>Indentation</h3>
<p>Python uses indentation for blocks, instead of curly braces. Both tabs and spaces are supported, but the standard
    indentation requires standard Python code to use four spaces. For example:</p>
<pre>
                        <code>x = 1
                        if x == 1:
                            # indented four spaces
                            print("x is 1.")
                        </code>
                    </pre>
