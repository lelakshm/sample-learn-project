<h1>String Formatting</h1>
<hr/>

<p>Python uses C-style string formatting to create new, formatted strings. The "%" operator is used to format a set of variables enclosed in a "tuple" (a fixed size list), together with a format string, which contains normal text together with "argument specifiers", special symbols like "%s" and "%d".</p>
<p>Let's say you have a variable called "name" with your user name in it, and you would then like to print(out a greeting to that user.)</p>
<pre>
                        <code># This prints out "Hello, John!"
                        name = "John"
                        print("Hello, %s!" % name)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
<p>To use two or more argument specifiers, use a tuple (parentheses):</p>
<pre>
                        <code># This prints out "John is 23 years old."
                        name = "John"
                        age = 23
                        print("%s is %d years old." % (name, age))
                        </code>
                    </pre>
<p>Any object which is not a string can be formatted using the %s operator as well. The string which returns from the "repr" method of that object is formatted as the string. For example:</p>
<pre>
                        <code># This prints out: A list: [1, 2, 3]
                        mylist = [1,2,3]
                        print("A list: %s" % mylist)
                        </code>
                    </pre>
